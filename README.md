# WeWork Website Clone with React.js and CMS

This project is a clone of the WeWork website, implemented in React.js with a Content Management System (CMS) for content management. Users can view the webpage, while administrators have the capability to update the webpage's content using the integrated CMS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:

### 1. `component`

In this folder, you'll find the core code for the WeWork website. This is where the front-end components are defined, and the content is dynamically fetched from the `db.json` file.

### 2. `jsondata`

This folder is dedicated to the CMS functionality. Administrators can log in and use the CMS to view and edit the website's content.
